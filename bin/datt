# datt (docker attach)
# usage:

# bin/datt <container name>
#
# bin/datt rails
# if docker ps shows a container with the name "rails" in it, this will attach you to the container
# this is useful when running debugger or pry

# note that if you have two containers that can both match the <container name> substring
# results are unpredictable

docker attach $( docker ps | grep $1 | awk "{print \$1}" | head -n 1 )
